VisualTraceroute
================

VisualTraceroute is a simple GUI based traceroute application that can map
the route to Google Maps using MaxMinds GeoIP database.

Usage
-----

Just run the application in either Windows or Mono (.NET [Client Profile] required).
Enter a target and wait for the traceroute to finish. Once it is done, you can map
it on Google Maps.

Accuracy of data
----------------

Because of limitations of ICMP and Geoip the data provided by VisualTraceroute
is only of informational value and should not be used for any serious purpouses.

Maxmind GeoIP
-------------

This application includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from 
http://www.maxmind.com. It also uses MaxMinds C# Api.

### Accuracy of Geoip
By default this application uses the free GeoLiteCity database (in /res/GeoLiteCity.dat).
If you have a commercial database you can switch to it from whitin the application.

Note that there are limits as to how accurate such a system can be. Many routers are fairly
'close' (geographically speaking) so Geoip will report the same city for such nodes.
